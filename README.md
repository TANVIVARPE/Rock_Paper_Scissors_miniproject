# Rock_Paper_Scissors_miniproject
I have developed this mini project- Rock Paper- Scissors. I is a user vs computer game. In this game the user plays with the computer and keeps the score of each round, whether user has won or computer or was it a tie, and when user wants to exit this game, the game displays who has won how many times. I have developed it in Java on Eclipse IDE.
