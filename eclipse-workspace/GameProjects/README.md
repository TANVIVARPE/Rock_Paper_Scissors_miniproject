# Rock Paper Scissors - Java Mini Project

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Java. This project was built to practice core Java concepts like:

- Loops
- Conditional Logic
- User Input
- Random Number Generation
- Functions (Methods)

## How to Play

- The user chooses between `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
- The computer randomly picks one as well.
- The winner is decided based on classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
- Scores are tracked over multiple rounds.

## Concepts Used

- Java `Scanner` class for input
- `if-else` and `switch` statements
- `Random` class for computer choice
- Loops and score tracking

## How to Run

1. Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ)
2. Run the `Main.java` file (or whichever contains `public static void main`)
3. Play through the console by typing your choice
